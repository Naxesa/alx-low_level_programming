# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Project Overview

This project introduces basic programming concepts in C, focusing on variables, conditional statements (`if`, `if...else`), and loops (`while`). It also covers the use of arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.

## Resources

- Everything you need to know to start with C.pdf
- Keywords and identifiers
- Integers and arithmetic operators
- If and if...else statements
- Relational and logical operators
- While loops
- ASCII character set

> Note: You do not need to learn about `scanf`, `getc`, `getchar`, `EOF`, `EXIT_SUCCESS`, `time`, `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX`, `for` loops, `do...while` loops, or functions yet.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators (boolean operators) and how to use them
- What are the relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- How to use `if`, `if...else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print variables using `printf`
- How to use the `while` loop
- How to use variables within a `while` loop
- What is the ASCII character set
- Purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files must end with a new line
- A `README.md` file must be present at the root of the project folder
- Code must compile without errors or warnings
- No use of the `system` function
- Code must follow the Betty coding style (checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`)

You must complete the tasks yourself to meet the learning objectives.
